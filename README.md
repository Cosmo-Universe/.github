## What is Cosmolang?
Cosmolang operates across various abstraction levels, denoted by numerical values. These levels represent different abstraction tiers within the language, with higher numbers signifying increased abstraction.

* Level 0 corresponds to a low-level representation akin to working with bits.
* Level 1 embodies an assembly language abstraction, offering more advanced operations than raw bits.
* Level 2 aligns with Operating System Level Languages, providing functionalities and operations that interact more closely with the operating system.

Cosmolang is versatile in its ability to function seamlessly across these abstraction levels. Whether utilized at the bit level for precise control, as an assembly language for more advanced operations, or as an OS-level language for system-level interactions, Cosmolang adapts to various programming needs and complexities. This flexibility empowers developers to work with different levels of abstraction within the language as per their requirements.

Cosmolang is an advanced programming language that allows coding in various spoken languages like Mandarin or German. Specifically designed for advanced tech applications, Cosmolang enables developers to write code in their preferred language, enhancing accessibility and usability in global teams. It offers a plethora of features and tools to solve complex technological problems and craft innovative solutions. Cosmolang aims to bridge the gap between language and technology, making programming more accessible across different cultures and countries. 

Cosmolang offers the flexibility to integrate different syntaxes through the **Indexing Programming Language (***IPL***)** and **Integrated Syntax Pprogramming Language (***ISPL***)**. Developers who prefer Python's syntax have the option to use it in Cosmolang by installing it through the Cosmolang Language Transformation and Integration Platform (CLTAPL).

### The abstraction levels:
IPL, ISPL and UISICO are main cores of **Cosmolang**. They are interface that communicate with each other. If you want to read more, go to [Google (Click here)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mBSlSZudinbNahXsLd-zUwUrXeveHst2-VP4t8-ChV8/edit?usp=sharing)

This integration allows users who are familiar with Python syntax to use it in the Cosmolang environment. The CLTPL acts as a platform for transforming and integrating various syntaxes, giving developers the ability to use the syntax they know and prefer while leveraging the power and advantages of Cosmolang.

With ISPL in Cosmolang, developers can incorporate and utilize various syntaxes, such as Python's syntax, by integrating them into the language through a unified and cohesive system. This enables users to work with multiple syntaxes within the Cosmolang framework, fostering a more inclusive and versatile programming experience. The Integrated Syntax Programming Language streamlines the integration process, allowing for a cohesive blend of different syntaxes to suit developers' preferences and needs.

> IPL: IPL is a programming language that is heavily focused on indexing functions and operations. Using IPL in Cosmolang optimizes the indexing of data and the management of indexes within the code. This can help developers access, organize, and manipulate data efficiently, especially when it comes to complex data structures or large data sets.

## The type of Cosmolang
- Interfaces
In this section there are a bunch of interfaces like the IPL. The IPL is a resource managment system. Embedded syntax can run in this IPL and translate in other types in this programming language.
- Compiler
- Hyprid
- Interpreter
In this section there are e.G. Cosmolang Modular
